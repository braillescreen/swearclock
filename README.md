# Swearclock
# This is not the actual swear clock code - simply the output of running it 2000 times with duplicates removed 
# - which comes out at 1700 or so
#
# At the moment I don't want to share the actualy code but using this text file you should be able to have some fun.
#
# Pick a random line and search and replace _time_ with the current time.

# Happy swearing and happy time telling - love Rob xx (@robmanuel on Twitter)
